## Scaling Guide ##

This document provides guidelines for scaling the application, ensuring high availability, and optimizing performance.

---
**Horizontal Scaling**

1. Scaling Services:
    * Adjust Kubernetes replicas for each service to distribute the load.
    * Example: Modify the replicas field in the deployment YAML files.
    * Command:
        ```bash
        kubectl scale deployment api-gateway --replicas=5 -n app-namespace
        ```
2. Load Balancing:
    * Handled automatically by Kubernetes Ingress.
    * External requests are evenly distributed across replicas.

---
**Vertical Scaling**

1. Container Resources:
   * Adjust `resources.requests` and `resources.limits` in deployment YAML files to allocate more CPU and memory.
    * Example:
    ```yaml
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 256Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 1000m
            memory: 512Mi
    ```
2. Database Scaling:
    * Use connection pooling (e.g., via PgBouncer).
    * Add read replicas for high read throughput.

---
**Caching**

1. In-Memory Caching:
    * Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data, such as quest definitions.
    * Reduce database load by caching query results.

2. API Gateway Caching:
    * Implement caching at the API Gateway for static responses.
    * Use tools like FastAPI middleware for cache control.

---
**Monitoring and Alerts**

1. Monitoring:
    * Deploy Prometheus to collect metrics.
    * Use Grafana to visualize service performance.

2. Alerts:
    * Configure alerts for CPU, memory, and request latency thresholds.

---
**Fault Tolerance**

1. Probes:
    * Configure readiness and liveness probes for services in Kubernetes.
    * Example:
    ```yaml
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 3
          periodSeconds: 5
    ```
2. Rolling Updates:
    * Ensure smooth updates without downtime by using rolling updates in Kubernetes.

---
**Cost Optimization**

1. Auto-Scaling:
    * Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale services based on CPU or memory usage.
    * Command:
    ```bash
        kubectl autoscale deployment api-gateway --cpu-percent=70 --min=2 --max=10 -n app-namespace
    ```
2. Resource Requests:
    * Allocate minimum resources per pod to save costs.

---
**Step-by-Step Scaling**

1. Monitor the system load and identify bottlenecks.
2. Scale horizontally (increase replicas) for stateless services.
3. Optimize database performance with indexing and read replicas.
4. Cache frequent queries to reduce database and API load.
5. Continuously monitor and tweak resource allocations.
